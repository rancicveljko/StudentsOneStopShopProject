# StudentsOneStopShopProject
A web app made for students meant to be a hub for sharing studying material such as studying scripts and recorded lectures.
This was a team project i did with two friends for a class, my part was completing the connection between front-end and back-end with working on fetches on the front-end and controllers on the back-end.
